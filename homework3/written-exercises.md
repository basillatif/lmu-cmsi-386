# CMSI 386 Homework 3

Name: Jackson Watkins and Basil Latif

## Problem 1

For A[0][0], we get the memory address 0x556ec98891c0. For A[3][7], we get the memory address 0x556ec98892e8. When we generate all the possible array locations from A[0][0] to A[3][7], we find out that 8 bits are allocated for A[0][0] (0x556ec98891c0), A[0][1] (0x556ec98891c8), A[0][2] (0x556ec98891d0).

## Problem 2

The first declaration recognizes the location that a[n] is pointing to or referencing somewhere in main memory.
